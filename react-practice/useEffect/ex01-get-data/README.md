# exercise box

## About the setup

- This codesandbox has mock API server running.
- Products are at "/api/users"
- You can see the fields coming by console logging the output from axios call

## Challenges

- Make sure you use async/await [ 5 points ]

### one [success]

- The button `Click to load data from server` is not working. Fix the button. [ 10 points ]

### two [error]

- Handle error as well [ 5 points ]

### three [loading]

- Show loader (just a span with text `loading` for now will do), when the data is loading and hide it when the data comes up [10 points]
